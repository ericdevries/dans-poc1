# PoC

## How to run

Just execute the Main class in the project to run it with the basic provided dataset

To run it with your own dataset, do the following:

```shell

$ mvn clean package exec:java -Dpath=/path/to/deposit/
```

* First step is populating a dataset with all the information that we have from deposit.properties, dataset.xml, files.xml and possibly other bag metadata.
    * deposit.properties:
        - doi
        - userId
        - sword-token
        - urn
    * dataset.xml:
        - title
        - description
        - creators / authors
        - possibly related identifiers (TODO figure out what those are)
    * files.xml:
        - list of files
            - path, format and description

* With this dataset, generate a datacite.xml which contains basic information about the deposit.

* Next step is to get all possible metadata from the dataset.xml and other files, similar to how dd-ingest-flow gets this metadata.
    - See DepositToDvDatasetMetadataMapper

* Generate an ORE map using this metadata and the original dataset from the first step
    - TODO list all non-dynamic fields and how to populate them
    - TODO about files, not having a URL
    - TODO about namespaces, regarding non-namespaced @context items
    - TODO think about the ID, right now it is an URL like:   "@id": "https://dar.dans.knaw.nl/api/datasets/export?exporter=OAI_ORE&persistentId=doi:11.5072/DAR/A7AXZP",
    - @id should the be the DOI
    - file @id should be generated by ourselves
